    "**1. _(Fill-In)_** Suppose `a` and `b` are integer variables and a program calculates `a + b`. Now suppose `c` and `d` are string variables and a program performs the concatenation `c + d`. The two `+` operators here are clearly being used for different purposes. This is an example of `________`.\n",

    "**Answer:** False. Python prohibits you from creating new operators, and operator overloading cannot change how an operator works with built-in types.\n",
